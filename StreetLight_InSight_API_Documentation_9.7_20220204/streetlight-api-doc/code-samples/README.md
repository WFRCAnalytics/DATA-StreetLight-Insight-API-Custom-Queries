# Client Code Samples

This folder contains code samples from the [Quick Start tutorial](../quickstart). Before you can run them, you need to edit them to use your organization's API key instead of the one here (which is invalid and will not work). You also need to update the UUIDs in the requests to match the ones you receive from the server. Please follow the instructions in the [Quick Start tutorial](../quickstart).
